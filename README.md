HelloMoodMetric
===============

An example implementation of the Mood Metric SDK, for MacOS X and iOS,
based on the March 2015 version of the SDK documentation. It is updated
to work with the latest version of the Swift programming language, as
provided with XCode 7.3

Both the MacOS X and iOS targets are designed to log to the XCode console
and will not display anything in the application GUI.

This project is not provided by the people at [MoodMetric](http://www.moodmetric.com).
Instead, it was quickly put together during the Emotion Hack Day 2016 event,
to help other developers at the event see how they could leverage the ring in
the projects.
